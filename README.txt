Polisim is a simulator/game designed to realistically handle internal politics, with players representing parties.  It evolved out of a version based in Google Sheets (because PSM is a lunatic), and is now being moved to MatLab for more powerful, yet faster and simpler processing.

Open and run "init.m" to get started.
